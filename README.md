Remember to setup the database using the SQL files Dhina created first.

There's a possibility to read the path for the servlet.
basically u need to download TOMCAT server, 9.0.0.M10
and then import the servlet.jar into the lib of the TOMCAT folder.

Also, copy and paste mysql-connector-java in the TOMCAT lib folder
